Additional Materials for the ENSO-DHS Child Mortality Association Project

The file "SampleCode_ENSO_DHS Child Mortality.R" contains sample codes for the paper "Maternal Preconceptional and Prenatal Exposure to El Niño Southern Oscillation Levels and Child Mortality: A Multi-country Study".
- Data Preparation:
  1) variables used in the study;
  2) R packages necessary for this study.
- Step 1: selecting covariates for each mortality outcome based on LASSO regression.
- Step 2 (main models):
  1) deriving results for the associations between ENSO levels (MEI, ESPI, ONI, Nino 1+2, Nino 3.4) and child survival;
  2) estimating attributable fraction, the proportion of child deaths that can be attributed to ENSO exposure level.
- Step 3 (stratified analyses): generating results by subgroups defined by characteristics of study participants.
- Step 4 (meta-analyses): 1) conducting country-specific analyses; 2) pooling the estimates of country-specific associations using random effects models.
- Step 5 (sensitivity analyses):
  1) assessing the impact of ENSO exposure during the mothers’ preconceptional versus prenatal periods;
  2) repeating the main analysis by including a random effect for each country;
  3) repeating the main analysis by including a random effect for each DHS survey cluster.
